# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview
**Purpose**: Extracting and visualizing geoJSON data can provide unique insights into global phenomena. In this project I aimed to develop mastery of the Leaflet.js API to map global earthquake data. 

The data is taken from the USGS earthquake feed, which contains geoJSON data on the location and magnitude of earthquakes that occur each week.

## Results:
This dataset looks at the total earthquakes across the globe over a 1-week period. The visualizations of earthquake data (contained in the "Earthquake_Challenge" folder) reveals interesting trends regarding the location, magnitude, and frequency of earthquakes. 

- Most earthquakes are localized on or near fault lines. 
- The frequency of earthquakes appears especially high along the west coast and pacific northwest regions of the United States. However, the magnitude of these earthquakes appears to be relatively low compared to other regions of the globe.
- High magnitude earthquakes (3+) appear to be especially prevalant in the eastern hemisphere; particularly along the east coasts of Japan and Australia. In addition, there are a high number of these higher magnitude earthquakes near Indonesia and Singapore.
